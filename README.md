# go.llib.dev

This repository facilitates the use of the go.llib.dev custom domain within the Go import mechanism.
It utilizes GitHub Pages to provide meta information in the response,
indicating the location of the git repository for the requested package.

## Troubleshooting

Should the redirection cease to function, please ensure to:

- Verify the A records that are pointing towards the GitHub page IPs.
    - [custom domains and GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages)
- Confirm if GitHub pages are still operational/supported.
